# Foreword
> We shall not cease from exploration.

> And the end of all our exploring.

>Will be to arrive where we started. 
>
>And know the place for the first time 
>
>-- T. S. Eliot

The purest goals of science are to understand more about ourselves,
about the things around us, about our origins. Achieving this is perhaps
not as practical as inventing a machine to do things more efficiently,
or as critical as developing a drug to fight a disease. Such goals
however are meaningful in shaping the way we think, and help us to
find optimal solutions to coexist and connect with the world we live
in. 

[//]: # (####Learning Objectives})

At the end of this lesson, you should be familiar with the terminologies,
history and early models of our Universe. You will also begin to understand
astronomy as a scientific discipline based on observational evidence.
Finally, you will be introduced with the basics of telescopes and
use one to look at celestial objects. 

[//]: # (####Learning Flow})

Before the lecture, you will self-learn some astronomy through [Section
1.1.](#11-pre-lesson-homework) During the lecture in week 1, we will go through parts (not all)
of the content in Sections 1.2 and 1.3 as well as in-class Activities
1 and 2. During tutorial in week 2, mentors will facilitate the discussion
of question in Section 1.5 and perform Activity 3. Please attempt
the discussion questions before the tutorial.
