# Foreword
:::quote
We shall not cease from exploration. 

And the end of all our exploring. 

Will be to arrive where we started. 

And know the place for the first time.

\- T\. S. Eliot
:::

The purest goals of science are to understand more about ourselves,
about the things around us, about our origins. Achieving this is perhaps
not as practical as inventing a machine to do things more efficiently,
or as critical as developing a drug to fight a disease. Such goals
however are meaningful in shaping the way we think, and help us to
find optimal solutions to coexist and connect with the world we live
in. 

#### Learning Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you should be familiar with the terminologies,
history and early models of our Universe. You will also begin to understand
astronomy as a scientific discipline based on observational evidence.
Finally, you will be introduced with the basics of telescopes and
use one to look at celestial objects. 

#### Learning Flow

Before the lecture, you will self-learn some astronomy through Section
[1.1](</Chapter 1/Pre-Lesson Homework>). During the lecture in week 1, we will go through parts (not all)
of the content in Sections [1.2](</Chapter 1/Past Models of Our Universe/>) and [1.3](</Chapter 1/Introduction to Telescopes>) as well as [in-class Activities
1 and 2](</Chapter 1/In-class Activities>). During tutorial in week 2, mentors will facilitate the discussion
of question in Section [1.5](</Chapter 1/Discussion Questions>) and perform [Activity 3](</Chapter 1/In-class Activities>). Please attempt
the discussion questions before the tutorial.
