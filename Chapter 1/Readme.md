The purest goals of science are to understand more about ourselves,
about the things around us, about our origins. Achieving this is perhaps
not as practical as inventing a machine to do things more efficiently,
or as critical as developing a drug to fight a disease. Such goals
however are meaningful in shaping the way we think, and help us to
find optimal solutions to coexist and connect with the world we live
in. 

[//]: # (####Learning Objectives})

At the end of this lesson, you should be familiar with the terminologies,
history and early models of our Universe. You will also begin to understand

### 1.2.1 Mapping the Stars

Humans have been mapping out the stars for a very long time. Several
ancient architecture, artifacts and drawings were designed with reference
to the positions of celestial objects. These objects could be made
to record and study the seasons (to optimize agriculture activities),
for navigation, or even for religious and political purposes. A few
examples are listed below.

### 1.2.2 Geocentric, Static Earth and Perfect Circles

Greek philosopher Plato (424--348 BC) and later his student Aristotle
(384--322 BC) advocated a model where the Earth is at the center
of the Universe, while the Moon, Sun and planets orbit in concentric
circles around Earth. Although now we know that this model is wrong,
what the ancient Greeks did was still highly commendable. They tried
to make sense of the periodic motion of planets and Sun along the
ecliptic with a physical model. The act of doing so is aligned with
modern scientific thinking and processes. 

It should also be noted that not all Greek philosophers believed in
the geocentric model. The Pythagorean school of thought believed that
the Earth, the planets and the Sun are orbiting around a "central
fire". Aristarchus (310-230 BC) proposed the first heliocentric
model where the Earth orbits the Sun. These models were generally
sidelined in favour for the more influential Aristotlean school of
thought.

**If** Earth is moving,

**then** one should observe some stellar parallax (shift in position
of a nearby star against the background).

However as no stellar parallax had been observed in ancient times,
it was logical to conclude that Earth is static. 

There were unsurprisingly some elements of mysticism in the early
models. It was believed that circles and spheres are geometrically
perfect, and thus the motion of heavenly bodies must be in perfect
circles. 


### 1.2.3 Retrograde Motion of Planets

While the geocentric model generally accounts for the observed motions
of celestial bodies, it could not explain an anomalous behaviour of
planetary movement known as retrograde motion. Planets generally drift
from east to west along the ecliptic over the year. But sometimes
they appear to move backwards for weeks or months, before continuing
back in the usual direction.

![**Path of Mars across the fixed stars in the night sky as seen from
Earth.** From around August to October in 2003, the planet moved in
the opposite way, from west (left) to east (right). Image credit:

### 1.2.4 Ptolemy's Solution: Circles within Circles

Claudius Ptolemy (AD 100-170), Roman/Greek/Egyptian mathematician
and geographer made an ingenious twist to the geocentric model to
allow the model to fit observational data better. To the original
circular orbit of a planet which he called the deferent, he added
a smaller circle called the epicycle. The center of the epicycle is
on the (circumference of the) deferent, and the planet is on the (circumference
of the) epicycle. 

While the epicycle moves clockwise along the deferent, the planet
moves clockwise along the epicycle. When the (linear) direction of
motion in the epicycle is opposite to that in the deferent, retrograde
motion occurs. 

This circle within circle model allowed Ptolemy to have another set
of independent parameters: radius and period associated with the epicycle.
In more modern terms, Ptolemy decomposed a complicated periodic motion
(derived from astronomical observations) into two simple circular
periodic motion. Does this sound like something you have learned before?

Speaking of sound, to visualise with our ears Ptolemy's trick, run
the following in [Wolfram|Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/).

```
play sin(880 pi t) for 10 s
```
```
play sin(880 pi t)+0.1{*}sin(440 pi t) for 10 s
```

The first sound $\sin(880\pi t)$ you hear is analogous to the original
geocentric model with 1 circle. The second sound $\sin(880\pi t)+0.1\sin(440\pi t)$
is analogous to Ptolemy's geocentric model with an epicycle. Hear
for yourself to note the difference.

![Snapshots of simulated retrograde motion of a planet with Ptolemy's
geocentric model with one epicycle. ](<resources/Chapter 1/Ptolemy_retrograde.png>)


### 1.2.5 Heliocentric model

Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) published *On the Revolutions
of the Heavenly Spheres* in 1543, where he re-proposed the heliocentric
(Sun-centered). Earth was treated as just another planet doing circular
orbit around the Sun. He arranged the planets in order of distance
from the Sun using the period of orbit he calculated. Earth was the
third rock from the Sun, after Mecury and Venus, before Mars, Jupiter
and Saturn. He also used geometry and observational data to estimate
the relative distance from the Sun for different planets. 

The elegance of the heliocentric model comes from its ability to demonstrate
retrograde motion of planets in a simple way. Retrograde motion of
a planet can be observed around the time when it is at it's closest
distance to Earth.

![Snapshots of simulated retrograde motion of a planet with Corpernicus'
heliocentric model without epicycles.](<resources/Chapter 1/Copernicus_retrograde.png>)

Unfortunately, despite the elegance, Copernicus' model cannot account
for the observational data very well when it comes down to numbers.
To match the numerical data, he had to add epicycles to the heliocentric
orbits! This is one of the main reasons why many were skeptical of
Corpernicus' heliocentric model.. 

### 1.2.6 Tycho Brahe's Observations

Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) was the most respected astronomer of his
time. He took pride to make systematic and careful astronomical observations.
One of his early works was the sighting of a supernova in the constellation
of Cassiopeia in 1572. Tycho Brahe used this as evidence to challenge
the Aristotelian view that the heavens is unchanging,

He was offered an island by the Danish king, on which he built an
observatory and alchemy research centre. There, he constructed several
custom built (non-telescope) astronomical instruments capable of measuring
positions of celestial objects to 40'' (arcseconds!),
which far surpassed his contemporaries. The bulk of his observational
data was compiled compiled by Johannes Kepler in the *Rudolphine
Tables* published in 1627, several years after his death.

Brahe knew about Copernicus' heliocentric model and appreciated its
elegance but could not accept a moving Earth. He could not measure
stellar parallax, even with his accurate instruments. He maintained
a static Earth centered model where the Moon and Sun orbit the Earth
while the other planets orbit the Sun. 

Tycho fell out of favour with the new Danish king and moved to Prague
to begin work as Imperial Mathematician.

while the other planets orbit the Sun. \protect\href{https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tychonian_system.svg}{Image credit: Fastfission, PD}](<resources/Chapter 1/Tycho_system.PNG>)

### 1.2.7 Johannes Kepler and the Laws of Planetary Motion

In 1600, Prague, Brahe employed Johannes Kepler, a German mathematician,
to work on mathematical modelling to fit his observational data of
planetary motion. One year later, Brahe passed away and Kepler was
appointed as Brahe's successor and continued to work on the project.
Instead of using Brahe's geo-heliocentric model, Kepler adopted a
modified version of Copernicus' heliocentric model. Kepler found that
the data will fit very well in a heliocentric model if the planetary
orbit follows an elliptical path instead of a circular one.

In 1609, he published two laws of planetary motion and in 1619, he
published the third law. The laws are:

1. Law of ellipses: The orbit of each planet is an ellipse, with
the Sun located at one of its foci.
2. Law of equal areas: A line drawn between the Sun and the planet
sweeps out equal areas in equal times as the planet orbits the Sun. 
3. Harmonic Law: The square of the time taken for a planet to
complete one revolution about the Sun (relative to the stars) is directly
proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of the planet's
orbit. 

Mathematically, the equation of an ellipse in polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$
is given by 
$$
r=\frac{a(1-\epsilon^{2})}{1+\epsilon\cos\theta}
$$
where $a$ is the semi-major axis which is the longest line from the
center of the ellipse to its circumference, and $\epsilon$ is the
eccentricity, which characterises how elongated the ellipse is. 

![Anatomy of an ellipse. To see how the parameters affect the shape
of the ellipse, visualise it on \protect\href{https://www.desmos.com/calculator}{Desmos})(A0 Q6)](<resources/Chapter 1/Ellipse.png>)

The second law can be expressed mathematically by 
$$
\frac{dA}{dt}=\text{constant}
$$
It gives information of how fast the planet is moving at different
parts of the orbit.

It was later known that the second law is equivalent to the law of
conservation of angular momentum. Interested reader may refer to the
appendix for details.

The third law relates the sizes and periods of orbits for different
planets. 
$$
\left(\frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}}\right)^{2}\propto\left(\frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}}\right)^{3}
$$
It is interesting to note that Kepler published the first and second
law in 1609 using only data from Mars. The third law was published
much later in 1619 after a long attempt to find patterns that could
represent ''*universal music*'' , an old philosophical concept
that movements of celestial bodies follow some beautiful proportions,
like the proportions that give rise to musical notes.

## 1.3 Introduction to Telescopes

### 1.3.1 Purpose


A telescope is an astronomer's tool to observe faraway
objects. It is an optical instrument that utilizes lenses, mirrors
or a combination of both. The primary aim of a telescope is to gather
more light than the unaided human eye can gather and by concentrating
them, allow us to see fainter objects in the distance. For instance,
while the four Galilean moons[^1]
of Jupiter cannot be easily seen by the naked eye since they are too
faint, most telescopes will enable us to view them. Another important
feature of telescopes is their resolving power, which allows telescopes
to distinguish clearly between closely spaced objects. This is particularly
useful if we want to view individual objects clearly. A case in point
will be using telescopes with large resolving powers to resolve galaxies
to see that they are made up of millions of stars.

A common misconception is that telescopes are used for magnifying
objects. While telescope do magnify an image, this is not the primary
reason that they are useful. A small unclear image will only magnify
to become a big unclear image. Furthermore, because the amount of
light used to create the original image remains the same, as the light
spreads over a larger area, resulting in a fainter (magnified) image.
In practice, magnification of an image is done by changing the eyepiece
of a given telescope. 

### 1.3.2 Optical tube designs

Telescopes come in various types in terms its optical tube and mount.
Each design comes with its set of advantages and disadvantages. Depending
on the nature of observation, one particular type of telescope or
mount may be preferred over the others. In general, telescopes can
be classified into two types, namely Refractors and Reflectors. There
are also two kinds of mounts, namely the Altitude-Azimuth (Alt-Az)
and Equatorial mounts. 

#### Refractors

![](<resources/Chapter 1/Keplerian2.png>)

A refracting telescope makes use of specially designed lenses to bend
light from a distant object to a focus and form an image. The earliest
telescopes made in the 1600s were refracting telescopes. The figure
above shows how light rays are bent in a Keplerian refracting telescope.
In a refractor, parallel light rays from a distant object are first
focused with the help of a primary (objective) lens, creating a real
inverted image at the common focal point. This image is then magnified
with the help of the lens in the eyepiece.

Often, refractors are characterized by their long and slim optical
tubes due to the long focal lengths of their primary lenses. A long
focal length shortens the view of vision but improves magnification
with the eyepiece, making refractors ideal for observing closer and
bright objects such as the Moon and planets. Since the optical tube
is sealed off from the outside, effects due to external factors such
as air currents and changing temperatures that can disturb the image
capturing process are eliminated, producing steadier images. This
also means that the optical components in a refractor require minimal
maintenance and cleaning.

A disadvantage of refractors is that lenses can be heavy and costly.
While a larger primary lens allows for larger light-gathering power
and resolution power, it will also be more expensive to construct
and weigh more. Moreover, a longer optical tube will also be required
to bring the light rays into focus. This means that refractors with
larger lenses and hence larger aperture sizes or diameters tend to
be heavier and quite expensive. 

#### Reflectors

![](<resources/Chapter 1/Reflector2.png>)

As its name implies, a reflector telescope makes use of curved mirrors
that reflect light to a focus. The telescope was first introduced
by Isaac Newton in 1668 and thus also called a Newtonian telescope.
The figure above shows how light rays are reflected in a Newtonian
telescope. Parallel light rays from a distant object are first reflected
off a primary concave mirror before reflecting off the secondary plane
mirror, producing a real inverted image at the focal point of the
eyepiece lens.

Reflectors are commonly preferred over refractors due to several reasons.
Mirrors are easier to construct and less expensive than lenses. Mirrors,
no matter how large, are also generally thinner and weigh less compared
to lenses of the same sizes. While lenses require support only at
their edges, mirrors can be supported against a surface at its back.
This means that primary mirrors in reflectors can be made extremely
large, making them ideal for gathering light and achieving superior
resolving power. 

Reflectors are not without their disadvantages. Because they use open
optical tube assemblies, the mirrors in reflectors must be cleaned
periodically and realigned (collimated). An improperly aligned telescope
may result in blurry or distorted images. Moreover, the large reflecting
surface of the primary mirror may become tarnished when exposed to
open air after years of usage. 

![](<resources/Chapter 1/SchmidtCassegrain2.png>)

The Schmidt-Cassegrain is an upgraded version of the Cassegrain, a
reflecting telescope introduced in 1672 by the French priest Laurent
Cassegrain. Similar to the Newtonian reflector, it makes use of a
concave primary mirror but uses a convex secondary mirror instead.
The secondary mirror reflects the beam back towards the primary mirror,
where it passes through a hole bored in the center of the mirror and
comes to a focus just below it. This allows the focal point to be
much more accessible and enables the scope to be made much more compact
to a Newtonian reflector. The Schmidt-Cassegrain differs from the
usual Cassegrain by having an additional corrector lens at the front
of the telescope. The purpose of this lens will be discussed later. 


### 1.3.3 Telescope Mounts

A telescope's optics is only half the story. A telescope
mount is just as important as the optics since it must not only hold
the scope steadily, but allows it to point anywhere in the sky smoothly
and easily. In general, telescope mounts can be classified into Alt-Az
and Equatorial mounts. 

An Alt-Az mount is the easier one to construct. It allows for movement
in two angular directions. At your position on Earth, the mount allows
the telescope to move vertically about the altitude axis and horizontally
about the azimuth axis. Although easy to set-up, it has the drawback
that tracking accurately a distant object such as a star or galaxy
requires the telescope to be driven in both axes simultaneously at
varying speeds. However, another limitation is that the image will
rotate as the telescope tracks, and therefore during photography the
detector must also be counter-rotated during any exposure in order
to produce an un-trailed image. 

If one axis of the mount is made parallel to the Earth's
rotation axis (Earth's Polar axis) and the other axis
(declination axis) is perpendicular to this, then the mount is known
as an Equatorial Mount. The mount allows the telescope to move in
the direction of the Celestial North and South poles as well as east-west
(Figure 4b). This has the advantage that once the telescope is pointed
at a particular star or galaxy, then tracking of the object as the
Earth rotates is achieved simply by moving the telescope at a constant
speed around the polar axis only. Moreover, the image does not rotate
as the telescope tracks. However, the Equatorial mount is more difficult
to set up as it requires accurate alignment. In the Northern Hemisphere,
this can be done by aligning the scope to the North star Polaris[^2]. If Polaris is not visible because you are on the Equator (e.g. Singapore)
or in the Southern Hemisphere, alignment can done on a computerized
mount by aligning the scope to a star whose coordinates on the celestial
sphere are known.[^3] 

[^2]: Polaris (North star) is a star that appears almost directly above
the Earth's rotational axis in the Northern Hemisphere
(almost near the North Celestial Pole). As Earth rotates, every other
star seems to spin around the axis, tracing out a circle in the sky
but Polaris appears to stand still.

[^3]: In astrophotography where long exposures are needed to image an object,
a more precise but tedious manual alignment process known as the Drift
Alignment is usually performed. The details of this will not be covered
in these notes.

The equatorial mount requires stronger motors and sturdier mechanical
design since gravity pulls the mount at an angle. As such most large
telescopes uses the Alt-Az mount.

use?

### 1.3.4 Limitations

It is important to be aware that telescopes, like all other instruments,
come with their limitations and some of them can differ across designs. 

#### Resolving Power

No matter how good the optics of a telescope is, it has a limit to
which it can allow us to distinguish closely-spaced objects. In the
last chapter, we learn that the wave nature of light causes it to
diffract and bend around obstacles. This disruption causes light waves
to run into one another, interfering constructively and destructively.
Much like how light is diffracted when passing through a single slit
and causing the waves to form interference fringes, the circular opening
of a telescope creates a circular interference pattern. 

![Left: Simulated image of a star, showing the central Airy disk surrounded
by concentric faint rings. Right: Intensity profile of the radiation
pattern.](<resources/Chapter 1/Airy.png>)

A circular aperture is much like a single slit but exists in two dimensions
instead of one. Because of this, when you make an image of a distant
star, light from the star does not focus into a single point. Instead,
if you use an eyepiece with high magnification, you will see a disk
with faint rings around it (see figure above). The bending of light
caused by the circular aperture of your telescope results in light
waves interfering to form such an interference pattern, popularly
known as the Airy Disk. The angular radius $\theta$
of the Airy disk is given by 
$$
\sin\theta=1.22\frac{\lambda}{D}
$$
where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light and $D$ is the diameter
of the telescope aperture (size of the objective lens/mirror).

If two celestial objects have an angular separation of more than $\sin^{-1}\left(\dfrac{1.22\lambda}{D}\right)$,
the two objects can be clearly seen. We say that the image of the
objects are **resolved**. Conversely if the angular separation
is less than $\sin^{-1}\left(\dfrac{1.22\lambda}{D}\right)$, the
objects will be seen as a single fuzz. 

![**Left:** Two close stars appear as two Airy disks. **Center:**
It is hard to tell two stars apart when their Airy disks overlap.
**Right:** When two stars are as close as the radius of the Airy
disc, we cannot tell the apart.](<Resources/Chapter 1/Angular resolution.png>)

We see that, for a fixed primary lens or mirror the telescope uses,
the size of the Airy Disk depends solely on the diameter of the circular
aperture, or equivalently the diameter $(D)$ of the primary lens
or mirror in your telescope. This means that as the diameter of your
scope increases, the resolving power of your scope increases and you
are able to distinguish between stars that are closer together. 

Also note that if the telescope is designed to see in higher wavelengths
$(\lambda)$, the Airy disk will be larger as well. This is the reason
why radio telescopes need to be much larger than optical telescopes. 

The angular size of the Airy disk for a telescope is commonly called
the diffraction limit of the telescope.

#### Aberrations

Aberrations refer to defects in images that may occur as a result
of the limitations in the design and manufacture of a telescope's
optics. They may also occur in accessories such as eyepieces. Common
examples of aberrations include chromatic aberration, spherical aberration
(i.e. coma and astigmatism), field curvature and distortion. 

Chromatic aberration is the failure of a lens to bring all wavelengths
of visible light into a common focus. It is usually seen as a violet
halo around bright stars or fringes around bright objects such as
the Moon. Since different wavelengths of visible light are refracted
to different degrees (i.e. blue light refracts more than red light)
by a single type of glass, light coming through a lens can be focused
at different locations depending on their wavelengths; one wavelength
may be focused while the other wavelengths will be out of focus. This
is commonly experienced in refractors since they use lenses as their
primary objectives. To reduce chromatic aberrations, extra-low dispersion
glasses such as fluorite is commonly used in lens making and specially
designed lenses known as achromats are usually used alongside the
primary objective lens for correction. 

Spherical aberration refers to the failure of light rays passing at
different distances from the center of a lens or mirror to come to
a focus. Often, light rays through the edges of a lens or mirror focus
closer compared to rays near the principle axis. This occurs more
for optical systems with low f-number and results in distant objects
such as stars looking like blurred discs. To fix this type of aberration,
mirrors in Newtonians are often designed precisely with parabolic
curves. Primary lenses in refractors must be of the right shape to
minimize this error, usually with a more highly curved front surface
facing the sky. 

![Schematic of chromatic aberration (left) and spherical aberration
(right)](<resources/Chapter 1/Abberations.png>)


Coma and astigmatism are two special kinds of spherical aberrations.
Coma refers to light rays from a lens or mirror focusing off-axis.
The image shows up as little off-axis comet-shaped blobs that point
inwards towards the center of the field and get bigger as you look
towards the edge of the field of view. Astigmatism is another off-axis
effect caused when light rays are focused to different focus points
in the vertical and horizontal plane. It elongates images horizontally
and/or vertically, making them look cross-like. Coma is usually corrected
the same way spherical aberrations are reduced in the design of the
main scope while astigmatism is corrected with additional lenses or
lens elements to increase f-number. 

Field curvature occurs when an extended object or stars in the field
of view of a telescope do not focus on a flat surface. An object in
the center may be focused while others farther out are not. Similar
to astigmatism, it is usually corrected with additional lenses or
lens elements to increase the f-number. 

#### Atmosphere

The atmosphere is one of the major limitations when it comes to using
telescopes on Earth. No matter how well a telescope is perfectly designed,
the atmosphere diminishes and scatters light such that the faintest
and finest details are always just beyond our reach. Dust and water
can reduce the amount of light transmitting through our atmosphere.
Moreover, the effects of turbulence greatly affect the object being
observed through a telescope. Air turbulence refers to pockets or
layers of air of different temperatures and hence, densities, between
the telescope and the distant object. This results in changes of the
refractive index of air at these air pockets and layers, causing light
to undergo refraction repeatedly. As a result, stars and distant objects
may appear to  "jitter" or jump around
when viewed through a telescope. Our eyes often perceive this as 'twinkling'
and images captured may appear smeared. While some telescopes have
been designed to counteract the effects of this 'twinkle',
the images captured, although improved drastically, will never match
those captured by a telescope in space, where the effects of the atmosphere
are totally eliminated. 

#### Size and weight

Because of their mounts, telescopes are also limited in their sizes
and weight. The payload limit of the mount refers to the maximum weight
which the mount can safely carry. If the entire weight placed on the
mount is too heavy, the mount may fail to track and tip over. The
size limit of the mount refers to the largest telescope the mount
can carry. If the telescope is too large or too long, it may hit something
or the mount may not balance properly during tracking. Storage may
also become a problem if the telescope is too large. In general, Alt-Az
mounts offer a larger payload and size limit. These mounts are usually
lightweight and compact since they can be built smaller, making them
easier to carry and store. On the other hand, equatorial mounts have
lower payloads and size limits since they come with extended counterweights,
which are as heavy as telescopes. They therefore require more space
for their counterweights to swing and are more difficult to carry
and store. While a telescope with a larger aperture offers more light
gathering power and a higher resolution power, it comes at the expense
of being much bigger in size and heavier which are limited by the
payload and size limit of the mount it uses. 

### 1.3.5 Reading a telescope specifications

Aperture - The aperture refers to the diameter of the primary (objective)
lens or mirror of the telescope. It is usually stated in millimeters
(mm) or inches ($''$).

Focal Length - The focal length refers to the length over which light
rays passing through the primary (objective) lens or mirror come to
a focus on a (focal) plane. It is also stated in millimeters or inches.
An image of a distant object will be visible on a screen placed on
the focal plane. 

Magnification - This is a measure of how much an image is magnified
to our eyes and is controlled by the eyepiece we use. The eyepiece
also has a lens and its focal length. Magnification of a telescope
is calculated by taking the ratio of the focal length of the objective
lens or mirror to the focal length of the eyepiece. 

F-number (focal ratio) - This refers to the ratio of the focal length
of the objective lens or mirror to the diameter of the aperture. A
large focal ratio implies smaller aperture, lower light gathering
power as well as a narrower field of view (vice versa). For example,
a telescope whose primary (objective) focal length is 5 times that
of its aperture diameter has a f-number (focal ratio) of f/5. 

Resolving Power - This is the measure of the ability to distinguish
clearly small details of an object or two closely spaced from each
other. The larger a telescope's aperture, the smaller
the minimum resolvable angle between two distant objects and the larger
its resolving power. Resolving power can be calculated from Equation
and is usually expressed in arcseconds. 

### 1.3.6 Other wavelengths

Telescopes are not limited to the visible light of the electromagnetic
spectrum. In fact, astronomers use a number of telescopes sensitive
to different portions of the spectrum to study objects in space. The
following lists examples and some of their main uses. 

Radio telescopes - Since radio waves are transparent to Earth's
atmosphere, they are used for interferometry where a satellite and
a ground-based telescope correlate their signals to simulate a radio
telescope the size of the separation between the two telescopes. Mainly
used to study star birth during the early universe. Examples: Atacama
Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) that is ground-based and Spectr-R that
is space-based. 

Microwave telescopes - Primarily used to study the Cosmic Microwave
Background. Examples include Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and
Planck.

Infrared telescopes - Infrared radiation is limited by Earth's
atmosphere and such telescopes are best sent to space or used on mountaintops
where the atmosphere is thin. Used to study stellar nurseries, nebulae
and red-shifted galaxies. Examples include the James Webb Space Telescope,
Herschel and Spitzer Space Telescope.

Optical and ultraviolet telescopes - These wavelengths are also limited
by Earth's atmosphere and the best images are only
captured in space. Used to study a wide variety of objects including
planets, stars, galaxies, galaxy structures, planetary nebulae and
protoplanetary disks. Domestic telescopes are optical telescopes.
A famous telescope that uses optical and ultraviolet wavelengths is
the Hubble Space Telescope. 

X-ray telescopes - Since X-rays are blocked by Earth's
atmosphere, telescopes are mainly space-based. Primarily used for
detection of black holes, supernovae remnants, galaxy clusters, some
binary stars and neutron stars. Examples include X-ray Multi Mirror
Mission (XMM) and Chandra. 

Gamma ray telescopes - Since Gamma rays are blocked by Earth's
atmosphere, telescopes are mainly space-based. Used to detect and
study high energy gamma ray astrophysical sources such as gamma ray
bursts, supernovae, neutron stars, pulsars and black holes. Examples
include Fermi Space Telescope and the Swift Explorer.

## 1.5 Discussion questions
1. Why do ancient stargazers call planets "wandering stars"? 
2. Does the Sun rise in the East? Same position in the East everyday?
Use Stellarium to find out! On Stellarium, look to the East. Set the
time to around 6:30---7:00 am to see the sunrise. Increase the date
by a month repeatedly. Does the position of sunrise change over the
year? Describe your observations
3. It takes 365 days for Earth to complete 1 revolution (2 $\pi$ radians)
around the Sun. What is the angular speed (rad/s) and speed (m/s)
of Earth in the rest frame of the Sun?
4. Suppose you want to reach Alpha Centauri (nearest star to us) in 100

(nearest galaxy to us) in 100 years?
5. The Moon's equatorial diameter is 3.476 km and its orbital distance
from Earth varies between 356 400 km and 406 700 km. The Sun's diameter
is 1390 000 km and distance from Earth ranges between 147.5 and 152.6
million km. Find the Moon's and Sun' angular size at their respective
minimum and maximum distance from Earth. Discuss the implications

the ancient Greeks to the modern view. 

## 1.-1 Appendix

Kepler's second law is in fact conservation of angular
momentum **L**.

Kepler's second law gives
$$
\frac{dA}{dt}=\frac{1}{2}r^{2}\frac{d\theta}{dt}=\text{constant}
$$

Angular momentum **L** is defined by 
$$
\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}=m\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{v}
$$

The magnitude of angular momentum is 
$$
|\mathbf{L}|=L=mrv\sin\alpha
$$
where $\alpha$ is the angle between $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{v}$.

![](<resources/Chapter 1/angularMomentum.png>)

From the diagram above, we see that 
$$
v\sin\alpha dt =rd\theta
$$
$$
v\sin\alpha =r\frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$

Putting this into the expression for the magnitude of angular momentum,
we have
$$
L=mr^{2}\frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$

Since Kepler's second law says that 

$$
\frac{dA}{dt}=\frac{1}{2}r^{2}\frac{d\theta}{dt}=\text{constant},
$$
this implies that 
$$
L=2m\frac{dA}{dt}=\text{constant}.
$$
