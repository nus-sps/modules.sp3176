# The Big Bang Theory

:::quote
We are now prepared to follow the course of cosmic evolution through the first three minutes. Events move much more swiftly at first than later, so it would not be useful to show pictures spaced at equal time intervals, like an ordinary movie. Instead, I will adjust the speed of our film to the falling temperature of the Universe... -- Steven Weinberg

#### Learning Objectives

You have probably heard about the term “Big Bang” since you were a kid / toddler (in case you’re still a kid). But what exactly is the Big Bang theory about, and how do we know it is true? We will find out in this chapter.

#### Learning flow

We will take this chapter in an “easy-mode”. As the semester is ending, there will be no assessments related to this chapter. Deepavali and NUS wellness day typically falls around this time, as such some lessons may be cancelled. We will take it easy and see how far we go in these 1-2 weeks.
