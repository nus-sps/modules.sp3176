## 8.1 Pre-Lecture Homework

### Steady State vs Big Bang

Do an internet search for the theories of Steady State vs Big Bang (avoid some of the trashy YouTube vids). Make a comparison between the theories and reflect upon the controversy that lasted on decades. Dig into the life (and science) of Fred Hoyle, an admirable scientist who probably should have won the Nobel Prize.
