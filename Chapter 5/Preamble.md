# Through the Looking Glass

## Preamble

:::quote
O, telescope, instrument of much knowledge, more precious than any
sceptre, is not he who holds thee in his hand made king and lord of
the works of God? 

\-  Johannes Kepler
:::

Galileo was not the inventor of the telescope. But he was the first
to use it to make scientific discoveries! Almost everything we know
about the Universe comes from this family of devices. The quest to
see better, see more and see further never ends. The James Webb Telescope,
successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, was launched last Christmas
(25 Dec 2021).

This chapter has been prepared with Koh Zhi Yong and Gerald Kang Joon
Kiat.

#### Learning Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will understand how distance and other
physical quantities are measured in astronomy. You will also appreciate
how the study of certain celestial objects help us to understand our
Universe as a whole.
