## 5.6 Discussion Questions

1. Bats use echolation to determine distance. Can you think of a similar
way to measure astronomical distances? Can we use this to find method
the Astronomical Unit?

2. Read about Mira "the wonderful" star in the following articles

[!badge text="Article 1"](https://cosmicpursuits.com/2297/mira-wonderful-star/)  [!badge text="Article 2"](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/review/posters/GALEX_mira_poster/mira_poster_back_all.pdf)

and answer the following questions. 

(a) Assuming that Mira is 100 parsecs away from us, calculate the
absolute magnitude of Mira when it is at its brightest
and dimmest. In terms of luminosity, how much brighter or dimmer
is Mira as compared to the Sun? 


(b) "*Mira is plunging through our part of the Milky Way
with an unusually large space velocity, 130 kilometers per second*."
Is this velocity in the radial direction?

3. Refer to Figure 1 of Kaspi et al.[^1]
Compare the spectrums of PG 1351, PG 1354 and PG 1512 and discuss.
From the spectrum of PG1512, what is the wavelength of the photons
corresponding to the most prominent peak emitted from the quasar?
(Obtain information on the redshift from Table 1 in the paper.)

4. Given the redshift of a particular quasar to be $z=2.504$, what
is the observed wavelength of the Hydrogen Ly $\alpha$ line?

5. In radio astronomy, spectral lines are usually displayed in a very
different way. This is due to the unique way of data collection where
the radio telescope/spectrometer scans a very narrow band of wavelegths
at a time. Radio astronomers thus need to know exactly what they want
to look for. This can be done by looking up the rest frame frequencies
of their objects of interest. An example is as follows: 

![Spectra of $\text{HeH}^+$ $J=1\rightarrow0$ and CO $J=11\rightarrow10$
rotational energy levels transitions in NGC 7027.](</Resources/Chapter 5/HeHNGC7027.PNG>)

Note that the horizontal axis is given in terms of velocity. This
velocity is the velocity of the source and this is related to Doppler
redshifts.

(a) Using velocity as the horizontal axis may seem to be a strange
choice. Can you think of a reason why this is useful in context of
collecting a spectrum of a nebula (cloud of gas in between stars)?

Clue: this paper is on the "Astrophysical detection of the funny
molecule $\text{HeH}^+$". So why is the CO spectrum doing there?

(b) Given that the spectral resolution of the $\text{HeH}^+$ spectrum
is 3.6 km $\text{s}^{-1}$. Find the spectral resolution in terms of MHz.

Clue: Use the formulae related to Doppler redshift.

6. In Hubble's 1929 paper, he deduced the famous equation
$$
v=H_{0}d
$$
from the velocities and distance of several spiral galaxies. Perform
a statistical analysis to determine the goodness-of-fit of his relation
on his data (given below).
