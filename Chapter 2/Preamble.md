To study the motion of objects under the influence of forces, Newton
developed a new branch of mathematics, now known as Calculus. Calculus
is the study of infinitesimal changes of variables, how one change
impact another. The technique turns out to be not just useful for
studying motion of particles. It can be applied to study all things
that change (smoothly). 

There used to be a time when all Science students take a course on
Calculus. This too have changed.

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this lesson, you should be able to understand how dynamical
situations can be modelled with differential equations (DEs). You
will be able to solve some simple DEs analytically and numerically.
The ultimate task is to solve the three-body (gravitational system)
problem using Newton's laws.

### Learning Flow

Before the lecture, you will read section [2.1](</Chapter 2/the apple>) to
learn about how initial conditions affects motion of objects under
gravitation. Most of the lecture (in week 2) will be spent on differential
equations where we will first solve a few cases by hand,(analytically)
and then introduce numerical methods (which you may recall learning
them in SP2273). In the tutorial (in week 3), we will move on to study
the case of a 2-body system and visualise the solution with animations
that you make. If we have time left, we will do the discussion questions
at the end.
