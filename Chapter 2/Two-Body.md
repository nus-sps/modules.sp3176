## 2.3 Two-Body Gravitating System

Let us now apply what we have learnt in an application of differential
equation that is perhaps the most famous work of Newton: How does
a planet orbit he Sun. We will use a familiar 2-body system, the Sun
and the Earth to illustrate. 

First fill in the following:

Radius of Sun $R=$

Average distance from Sun to Earth $R_{e}=$

Mass of Sun $M_{s}=$

Mass of Earth $M_{e}=$

Gravitational constant $G=$

Linear momentum of Earth $p_{e}=$

(We can get $p_{e}$ by knowing that the Earth circles around the
Sun in about 365 days. How?)

![](</resources/Chapter 2/Earth-Sun.png>)

Let ${\bf r}_{s}$ and ${\bf r}_{e}$ be the position vectors of the
Sun and Earth respectively. Express ${\bf r}_{se}$ in terms of the
two postition vectors. 

$$
{\bf r}_{se}=\phantom{{xxxxxxxxx}}
$$

Newton's Law of Gravitation: 
$$
{\bf F}=-\frac{GMm}{r^{2}}\hat{{\bf r}}
$$

Force that the Sun exerts on the Earth:
$$
{\bf F}_{se}=
$$


Force that the Earth exerts on the Sun:
$$
{\bf F}_{es}=
$$



Newton's second law (express in terms of rate of change of momentum)
$$
{\bf F}=\frac{d{\bf p}}{dt}
$$

Applying Euler's scheme for solving differential equation numerically 

$$
\begin{align*}
d{\bf p} & ={\bf F}dt\\
{\bf p}_{i+1} & ={\bf p}_{i}+d{\bf p}\\
 & ={\bf p}_{i}+{\bf F}_{i}dt
\end{align*}
$$

Relationship between momentum and position vector is given by ${\bf p}=m{\displaystyle \frac{d{\bf r}}{dt}}$

Applying Euler's scheme for solving differential equation numerically 

$$
\begin{align*}
d{\bf r} & =\\
{\bf r}_{i+1} & ={\bf r}_{i}+d{\bf r}\\
 & =
\end{align*}
$$
