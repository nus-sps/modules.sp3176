## 2.1 The Apple, The Cannonball and The Moon

An apple falls straight down. The moon orbits Earth in a circle (almost).
We know for a ''fact'' now that both motions are due to (the force
of) gravity between Earth and the apple/moon. But this was not an
obvious fact before Newton, simply because the motions looks so different. 

In the modern day, if you ask a mathematician/physicist why the apple
and the moon follow different paths despite both being acted by the
same type of force, you will probably get a reply like: 


> ''Oh yea gravity is Universal! It acts in the same way for both the apple and the Moon. It is just that the **initial conditions** were different, hence different paths exhibited.''

The reply probably would not enlighten many people. To visualise and
make sense of the above, I'll borrow the story used by [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)(1707-1783)
in one of his [letters to a German princess](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00283-021-10052-2). 

There is a cannon on a cliff, positioned such that it is parallel
to the ground. If the cannonball is released without any firepower,
the ball will fall straight down the cliff, much like how an apple
falls down a tree. If however, the cannon shoots the ball with some
firepower, the path will be a curve (projectile), and the ball will
fall some distance away from the cliff. The more firepower one uses
to shoot the ball, the greater the initial horizontal/tangential[^1]
speed of the ball, and the further away the ball will land. 

[^1]: Euler explained the concept of tangents in an earlier letter.

Now we know that while our Earth looks flat locally, it is actually
round. Suppose we have so much firepower at our expense, we can shoot
the ball with so much initial tangential speed such that the ball
goes almost round the Earth and fall right *behind* us! And
if we were to be so silly to shoot with just a little more tangential
speed, the ball will not land at all, but go round the Earth and hit
us from behind!! 

Perhaps we did shoot the cannonball with such an initial tangential
speed, but we pack the cannon and move away while the cannonball circumnavigated
the Earth. The ball will go round and round the Earth forever (assuming
no air resistance), much like how the Moon orbits the Earth.


!!! Try it yourself!

1. Provide an illustration to the above story.


2. What happens if one uses even greater firepower than the amount
neccessary for the ball to circumnavigate the Earth?
