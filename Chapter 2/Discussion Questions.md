## 2.5 Discussion Questions

1. Give some more examples of how differential equations are used
to model stuffs in science.

2. What is the benefit of solving the planetary motion problem numerically?
What is the benefit of solving the planetary motion problem analytically
(see for [example](https://brilliant.org/wiki/deriving-keplers-laws/))

3. We saw a conserved quantity for the case of love. For planetary
orbits, we saw that Kepler's second law is equivalent to the conservation
of angular momentum. Other than angular momentum, is there another
conserved quantity for planetary orbit? 

4. Study the comic below. Do you understand it?

5. The above is rather sadistic. A nicer application is the centrifuge
machine. Explain how the centrifuge is able to separate particles
of different sizes and masses.
