# Space and Time

## Preamble

:::quote
Henceforth, space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade
away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve
an independent reality. 

\- Hermann Minkowski (1864 - 1909)
:::

This chapter has been prepared with Koh Zhi Yong and Gerald Kang Joon
Kiat.

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will learn about concepts of space
and time in the mathematical framework of special relativity. Through
the eyes of two observers who are in constant motion relative to each
other, you will uncover bizarre consequences such as a moving rod measuring a shorter length and a moving clock ticking slower.
