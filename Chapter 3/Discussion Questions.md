## 3.8 Discussion Questions

1. Waves exhibit superposition. What physical phenomena are a result
of superposition of waves?

</br>

2. We saw how light passing through 2 slits exhibit a diffraction
pattern and understood it from the principle of superposition. Light
passing through a single slit also creates a diffraction pattern.
Explain single slit diffraction qualitatively.

</br>

3. How did Einstein use the particle model of light to explain the
findings of the photoelectric effect experiment?

</br>

4. How is spectroscopy used in other areas of science? Name some examples!

</br>

5. Derive the Rydberg formula Eq.(\ref{eq:rydberg}) using the Bohr
model. Evaluate the Rydberg constant $R$. 

</br>

6. Plot the spectra of the Lyman and Balmer series computationally.

7. Derive the allowed energy states and wavefunction for particle
in a box given Eq.(\ref{eq:piabEnergyStates}) and Eq.(\ref{eq:piabWavefunction}). 

Guiding steps, if you need: 

- Insert our guess solution Eq.(\ref{eq:ansatz}) into Eq.(\ref{eq:inside_box})
and to obtain the general solution Eq(\ref{eq:PiabGenSol}); 
\item Apply the boundary conditions to the general solution. Using Eq.(\ref{eq:piabBC1}),
you will find a sine function. Using Eq.(\ref{eq:piabBC2}) you will
find that only integer values of $\pi$ are allowed for the argument
in the sine function.
- Do a bit of algebra to get the allowed energy states.
-  Use the normalising condition given in Eq.(\ref{eq:normalisation})
to find the coefficient $A$.

8. Graph the particle in a box wavefunction for $n=$1, 2 and 3. Label
each sketch with the value of energy associated with each $n$.
