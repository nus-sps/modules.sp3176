## 3.8 Discussion Questions

1. Waves exhibit superposition. What physical phenomena are a result
of superposition of waves?

</br>

2. We saw how light passing through 2 slits exhibit a diffraction
pattern and understood it from the principle of superposition. Light
passing through a single slit also creates a diffraction pattern.
Explain single slit diffraction qualitatively.

</br>

3. How did Einstein use the particle model of light to explain the
findings of the photoelectric effect experiment?

</br>

4. How is spectroscopy used in other areas of science? Name some examples!

</br>

5. Derive the Rydberg formula Eq.([Spectroscopy(1)](</Chapter 3/Spectroscopy/#rydberg>)) using the Bohr
model. Evaluate the Rydberg constant $R$. 

</br>

6. Plot the spectra of the Lyman and Balmer series computationally. 

</br>

7. Derive the allowed energy states and wavefunction for particle
in a box given Eq.([QM(15)](</Chapter 3/Quantum Mechanics/#piabEnergyStates>)) and Eq.([QM(16)](</Chapter 3/Quantum Mechanics/#piabWavefunction>)). 

Guiding steps, if you need: 

- Insert our guess solution Eq.([QM(13)](</Chapter 3/Quantum Mechanics/#ansatz>)) into Eq.([QM(9)](</Chapter 3/Quantum Mechanics/#inside_box>))
and to obtain the general solution Eq([QM(14)](</Chapter 3/Quantum Mechanics/#PiabGenSol>)); 
- Apply the boundary conditions to the general solution. Using Eq.([QM(11)](</Chapter 3/Quantum Mechanics/#PiabBC1>)),
you will find a sine function. Using Eq.([QM(12)](</Chapter 3/Quantum Mechanics/#PiabBC2>)) you will
find that only integer values of $\pi$ are allowed for the argument
in the sine function.
- Do a bit of algebra to get the allowed energy states.
-  Use the normalising condition given in Eq.([QM(8)](</Chapter 3/Quantum Mechanics/#normalisation>))
to find the coefficient $A$.

</br>

8. Graph the particle in a box wavefunction for $ n= $ 1, 2 and 3. Label
each sketch with the value of energy associated with each $n$.
