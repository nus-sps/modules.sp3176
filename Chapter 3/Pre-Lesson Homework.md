## 3.1 Pre-Lecture Homework

### 3.1.2 Some mathy stuffs

**Graph** 
$$
y=A\sin(kx+\omega t+\phi)
$$
on Desmos and investigate how $k$, $\omega,\phi$ and $A$ affect
the shape of the wave. Also identify which variable relates to the
wavelength, $\lambda$ and frequency, $f$ of the wave.



**Google** Euler's formula and complete the equation below
$$
e^{i(kx-\omega t)}=
$$

**Read** Ervin's article on Fourier Representation. Find in the
Canvas $\rightarrow$ SP3176 $\rightarrow$ Files $\rightarrow$ Lecture
Notes.

### 3.1.2 Force and potential

Force is a vector quantity. Sometimes it is tricky to find the force
(both magnitude and direction) at all positions. Fortunately there
is a scalar quantity known as Potential Energy $V$ that is closely
related to force $\mathbf{F}$ via
$$
\mathbf{F}=\left(\begin{array}{c}
F_{x}\\
F_{y}\\
F_{z}
\end{array}\right)=-\left(\begin{array}{c}
{\displaystyle \frac{\partial V}{\partial x}}\\
{\displaystyle \frac{\partial V}{\partial y}}\\
{\displaystyle \frac{\partial V}{\partial z}}
\end{array}\right)
$$

Consider a force 
$$
\mathbf{F}_{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{qq_{2}}{\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{3/2}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
x\\
y\\
z
\end{array}\right)
$$
Verify that 
$$
V=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\right)^{1/2}}
$$
is the potential energy for $\mathbf{F}_{E}$.
(Do feel free to use [!badge icon="/resources/common/wolframalpha.svg" text="Wolfram|Alpha"](https://wolframalpha.com) to help with
the differentiation.)

The mechanics of a system of particles can be equivalently studied
using either forces or energy. Often the latter is preferred as the
expression for potential energy is simpler. Applying the **conservation
of energy** also allows us intuitively understand the behaviour of
a closed system.
