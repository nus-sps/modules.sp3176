description: "Light and Atoms"
---

### Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be familiar with the concept
of quantum mechanics and light, the history of the various atomic
models proposed and the reasons propelling them. You will also be
introduced to the field of spectroscopy as means to study light and
atoms together. Finally, a mention about the modern interpretation
of quantum mechanics with wavefunctions and probabilities is made.

### Learning flow

This chapter will span 2 weeks. 

Before week 3 lecture, do the pre-lecture homework and briefly read
through sections [3.2](<Light>), [3.3](<Spectroscopy>), and [3.4](<Atomic Models>).

During week 3 lecture, we will discuss the topics of light, spectroscopy
and early atomic models in [3.2](<Light>), [3.3](<Spectroscopy>), and [3.4](<Atomic Models>).
The content is heavy and possibly dry. Hence we intend to deliver
the content via the associated lecture activities, which are more
hands-on and visual. That is the plan, at least.

Before week 4 lecture, no pre-lecture homework. Just briefly read
through sections [3.4](<Atomic Models>)  and [3.6](<Molecular Orbitals>) .

During week 4 lecture we will go explore some aspects of modern quantum
mechanics. 

In week 4 IS, we will do discussion questions 1-6.

In week 5 IS, we will fully understand the quantum mechanics of a
particle in a box through questions 7 and 8.
