## 3.7 In-Class Activities

### Activity 1

Watch the ripple tank demo in lecture. Play with it in if time allows.
Note the interference pattern. 

On [!badge icon="/resources/common/Desmos-icon.png" text="Desmos"](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) enter the following lines:

$$
\begin{align*}
f & =\cos x\\
g & =\cos(x+\phi)\\
f & +g
\end{align*}
$$

Click to add slider for $\phi$ the phase angle, and set it to go
from 0 to $2\pi$. Slide to see how $g$ changes for different values
of $\phi$. Also observe how the superposition of the two waves $f+g$
changes.

Relate the math (graphs on Desmos) and the phenomenum (waves in ripple
tank).

### Activity 2

Form diffraction patterns using a thin wire, double slits, etc, and
a laser.

### Activity 3

Watch the photoelectric effect demo in lecture and try it out during
tutorial.

### Activity 4

Use a diffraction grating to look at various light sources: Gas discharge
lamps, LEDS, incandescent light bulb, etc.

### Activity 5

Play with the [!badge icon="/resources/common/PhET-icon.png" text="PhET"](https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/blackbody-spectrum/latest/blackbody-spectrum_en.html) blackbody simulator. [^1]

### Activity 6

Use a portable spectrometer (OceanOptics) to see the spectrum of sunlight.
Think of what is inside a spectrometer.

### Activity 7

See electron diffraction demo. Explain the observations.
