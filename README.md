# Welcome!

Eric was here!

Welcome to the homepage for SP3176: The Universe.

Here you'll find links to lessons, assignments, as well as a mobile friendly version of the notes.

This module traces the developments in theoretical and observational cosmology, starting from Newtonian cosmology, Hubbleâ€™s observations, the Big Bang, formation of stars and black holes to recent ideas in the origin and fate of the Universe. An additional emphasis is placed on practical skills, including Telescope use, and Atomic Spectroscopy.
