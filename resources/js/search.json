It is an optical instrument that utilizes lenses, mirrors or a combination of both. The primary aim of a telescope is to gather more light than the unaided human eye can gather and by concentrating them, allow us to see fainter objects in the distance. For instance, while the four Galilean moons<a id=\"fnref:1\" href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\"><sup>1</sup></a> of Jupiter cannot be easily seen by the naked eye since they are too faint, most telescopes will enable us to view them. Another important feature of telescopes is their resolving power, which allows telescopes to distinguish clearly between closely spaced objects. This is particularly useful if we want to view individual objects clearly. A case in point will be using telescopes with large resolving powers to resolve galaxies to see that they are made up of millions of stars.","Upper: Jupiter and the 4 Galilean moons taken with an amateur telescope. Image credit: Jan Sandberg. Lower: Millions of stars in Andromeda, taken by Hubble Space Telescope Image credit: NASA, ESA.","A common misconception is that telescopes are used for magnifying objects. While telescope do magnify an image, this is not the primary reason that they are useful. A small unclear image will only magnify to become a big unclear image. Furthermore, because the amount of light used to create the original image remains the same, as the light spreads over a larger area, resulting in a fainter (magnified) image. In practice, magnification of an image is done by changing the eyepiece of a given telescope."]},{"i":"132-optical-tube-designs","l":"1.3.2 Optical tube designs","p":["Telescopes come in various types in terms its optical tube and mount. Each design comes with its set of advantages and disadvantages. Depending on the nature of observation, one particular type of telescope or mount may be preferred over the others. In general, telescopes can be classified into two types, namely Refractors and Reflectors. There are also two kinds of mounts, namely the Altitude-Azimuth (Alt-Az) and Equatorial mounts.","A refracting telescope makes use of specially designed lenses to bend light from a distant object to a focus and form an image. The earliest telescopes made in the 1600s were refracting telescopes. The figure above shows how light rays are bent in a Keplerian refracting telescope. In a refractor, parallel light rays from a distant object are first focused with the help of a primary (objective) lens, creating a real inverted image at the common focal point. This image is then magnified with the help of the lens in the eyepiece.","Often, refractors are characterized by their long and slim optical tubes due to the long focal lengths of their primary lenses. A long focal length shortens the view of vision but improves magnification with the eyepiece, making refractors ideal for observing closer and bright objects such as the Moon and planets. Since the optical tube is sealed off from the outside, effects due to external factors such as air currents and changing temperatures that can disturb the image capturing process are eliminated, producing steadier images. This also means that the optical components in a refractor require minimal maintenance and cleaning.","A disadvantage of refractors is that lenses can be heavy and costly. While a larger primary lens allows for larger light-gathering power and resolution power, it will also be more expensive to construct and weigh more. Moreover, a longer optical tube will also be required to bring the light rays into focus. This means that refractors with larger lenses and hence larger aperture sizes or diameters tend to be heavier and quite expensive.","As its name implies, a reflector telescope makes use of curved mirrors that reflect light to a focus. The telescope was first introduced by Isaac Newton in 1668 and thus also called a Newtonian telescope. The figure above shows how light rays are reflected in a Newtonian telescope. Parallel light rays from a distant object are first reflected off a primary concave mirror before reflecting off the secondary plane mirror, producing a real inverted image at the focal point of the eyepiece lens.","Reflectors are commonly preferred over refractors due to several reasons. Mirrors are easier to construct and less expensive than lenses. Mirrors, no matter how large, are also generally thinner and weigh less compared to lenses of the same sizes. While lenses require support only at their edges, mirrors can be supported against a surface at its back. This means that primary mirrors in reflectors can be made extremely large, making them ideal for gathering light and achieving superior resolving power.","Reflectors are not without their disadvantages. Because they use open optical tube assemblies, the mirrors in reflectors must be cleaned periodically and realigned (collimated). An improperly aligned telescope may result in blurry or distorted images. Moreover, the large reflecting surface of the primary mirror may become tarnished when exposed to open air after years of usage.","The Schmidt-Cassegrain is an upgraded version of the Cassegrain, a reflecting telescope introduced in 1672 by the French priest Laurent Cassegrain. Similar to the Newtonian reflector, it makes use of a concave primary mirror but uses a convex secondary mirror instead. The secondary mirror reflects the beam back towards the primary mirror, where it passes through a hole bored in the center of the mirror and comes to a focus just below it. This allows the focal point to be much more accessible and enables the scope to be made much more compact to a Newtonian reflector. The Schmidt-Cassegrain differs from the usual Cassegrain by having an additional corrector lens at the front of the telescope. The purpose of this lens will be discussed later."]},{"i":"133-telescope-mounts","l":"1.3.3 Telescope Mounts","p":["A telescope's optics is only half the story. A telescope mount is just as important as the optics since it must not only hold the scope steadily, but allows it to point anywhere in the sky smoothly and easily. In general, telescope mounts can be classified into Alt-Az and Equatorial mounts.","An Alt-Az mount is the easier one to construct. It allows for movement in two angular directions. At your position on Earth, the mount allows the telescope to move vertically about the altitude axis and horizontally about the azimuth axis. Although easy to set-up, it has the drawback that tracking accurately a distant object such as a star or galaxy requires the telescope to be driven in both axes simultaneously at varying speeds. However, another limitation is that the image will rotate as the telescope tracks, and therefore during photography the detector must also be counter-rotated during any exposure in order to produce an un-trailed image.","If one axis of the mount is made parallel to the Earth's rotation axis (Earth's Polar axis) and the other axis(declination axis) is perpendicular to this, then the mount is known as an Equatorial Mount. The mount allows the telescope to move in the direction of the Celestial North and South poles as well as east-west(Figure 4b). This has the advantage that once the telescope is pointed at a particular star or galaxy, then tracking of the object as the Earth rotates is achieved simply by moving the telescope at a constant speed around the polar axis only. Moreover, the image does not rotate as the telescope tracks. However, the Equatorial mount is more difficult to set up as it requires accurate alignment. In the Northern Hemisphere, this can be done by aligning the scope to the North star Polaris<a id=\"fnref:2\" href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\"><sup>2</sup></a>. If Polaris is not visible because you are on the Equator (e.g. Singapore) or in the Southern Hemisphere, alignment can done on a computerized mount by aligning the scope to a star whose coordinates on the celestial sphere are known.<a id=\"fnref:3\" href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\"><sup>3</sup></a>","The equatorial mount requires stronger motors and sturdier mechanical design since gravity pulls the mount at an angle. As such most large telescopes uses the Alt-Az mount.","Ex. Can you determine which type of scope and mount the SPS telescopes use?"]},{"i":"134-limitations","l":"1.3.4 Limitations","p":["It is important to be aware that telescopes, like all other instruments, come with their limitations and some of them can differ across designs."]},{"l":"Resolving Power","p":["No matter how good the optics of a telescope is, it has a limit to which it can allow us to distinguish closely-spaced objects. In the last chapter, we learn that the wave nature of light causes it to diffract and bend around obstacles. This disruption causes light waves to run into one another, interfering constructively and destructively. Much like how light is diffracted when passing through a single slit and causing the waves to form interference fringes, the circular opening of a telescope creates a circular interference pattern.","Left: Simulated image of a star, showing the central Airy disk surrounded by concentric faint rings. Right: Intensity profile of the radiation pattern.","A circular aperture is much like a single slit but exists in two dimensions instead of one. Because of this, when you make an image of a distant star, light from the star does not focus into a single point. Instead, if you use an eyepiece with high magnification, you will see a disk with faint rings around it (see figure above). The bending of light caused by the circular aperture of your telescope results in light waves interfering to form such an interference pattern, popularly known as the Airy Disk. The angular radius \\theta of the Airy disk is given by","where \\lambda is the wavelength of the light and D is the diameter of the telescope aperture (size of the objective lens/mirror).","If two celestial objects have an angular separation of more than \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{1.22\\lambda}{D}\\right), the two objects can be clearly seen. We say that the image of the objects are resolved. Conversely if the angular separation is less than \\sin^{-1}\\left(\\dfrac{1.22\\lambda}{D}\\right), the objects will be seen as a single fuzz.","Left: Two close stars appear as two Airy disks. Center: It is hard to tell two stars apart when their Airy disks overlap. Right: When two stars are as close as the radius of the Airy disc, we cannot tell the apart.","We see that, for a fixed primary lens or mirror the telescope uses, the size of the Airy Disk depends solely on the diameter of the circular aperture, or equivalently the diameter (D) of the primary lens or mirror in your telescope. This means that as the diameter of your scope increases, the resolving power of your scope increases and you are able to distinguish between stars that are closer together.","Also note that if the telescope is designed to see in higher wavelengths(\\lambda), the Airy disk will be larger as well. This is the reason why radio telescopes need to be much larger than optical telescopes.","The angular size of the Airy disk for a telescope is commonly called the diffraction limit of the telescope."]},{"l":"Aberrations","p":["Aberrations refer to defects in images that may occur as a result of the limitations in the design and manufacture of a telescope's optics. They may also occur in accessories such as eyepieces. Common examples of aberrations include chromatic aberration, spherical aberration(i.e. coma and astigmatism), field curvature and distortion.","Chromatic aberration is the failure of a lens to bring all wavelengths of visible light into a common focus. It is usually seen as a violet halo around bright stars or fringes around bright objects such as the Moon. Since different wavelengths of visible light are refracted to different degrees (i.e. blue light refracts more than red light) by a single type of glass, light coming through a lens can be focused at different locations depending on their wavelengths; one wavelength may be focused while the other wavelengths will be out of focus. This is commonly experienced in refractors since they use lenses as their primary objectives. To reduce chromatic aberrations, extra-low dispersion glasses such as fluorite is commonly used in lens making and specially designed lenses known as achromats are usually used alongside the primary objective lens for correction.","Spherical aberration refers to the failure of light rays passing at different distances from the center of a lens or mirror to come to a focus. Often, light rays through the edges of a lens or mirror focus closer compared to rays near the principle axis. This occurs more for optical systems with low f-number and results in distant objects such as stars looking like blurred discs. To fix this type of aberration, mirrors in Newtonians are often designed precisely with parabolic curves. Primary lenses in refractors must be of the right shape to minimize this error, usually with a more highly curved front surface facing the sky.","Schematic of chromatic aberration (left) and spherical aberration (right)","Coma and astigmatism are two special kinds of spherical aberrations. Coma refers to light rays from a lens or mirror focusing off-axis. The image shows up as little off-axis comet-shaped blobs that point inwards towards the center of the field and get bigger as you look towards the edge of the field of view. Astigmatism is another off-axis effect caused when light rays are focused to different focus points in the vertical and horizontal plane. It elongates images horizontally and/or vertically, making them look cross-like. Coma is usually corrected the same way spherical aberrations are reduced in the design of the main scope while astigmatism is corrected with additional lenses or lens elements to increase f-number.","Field curvature occurs when an extended object or stars in the field of view of a telescope do not focus on a flat surface. An object in the center may be focused while others farther out are not. Similar to astigmatism, it is usually corrected with additional lenses or lens elements to increase the f-number."]},{"l":"Atmosphere","p":["The atmosphere is one of the major limitations when it comes to using telescopes on Earth. No matter how well a telescope is perfectly designed, the atmosphere diminishes and scatters light such that the faintest and finest details are always just beyond our reach. Dust and water can reduce the amount of light transmitting through our atmosphere. Moreover, the effects of turbulence greatly affect the object being observed through a telescope. Air turbulence refers to pockets or layers of air of different temperatures and hence, densities, between the telescope and the distant object. This results in changes of the refractive index of air at these air pockets and layers, causing light to undergo refraction repeatedly. As a result, stars and distant objects may appear to \"jitter\" or jump around when viewed through a telescope. Our eyes often perceive this as 'twinkling' and images captured may appear smeared. While some telescopes have been designed to counteract the effects of this 'twinkle', the images captured, although improved drastically, will never match those captured by a telescope in space, where the effects of the atmosphere are totally eliminated."]},{"l":"Size and weight","p":["Because of their mounts, telescopes are also limited in their sizes and weight. The payload limit of the mount refers to the maximum weight which the mount can safely carry. If the entire weight placed on the mount is too heavy, the mount may fail to track and tip over. The size limit of the mount refers to the largest telescope the mount can carry. If the telescope is too large or too long, it may hit something or the mount may not balance properly during tracking. Storage may also become a problem if the telescope is too large. In general, Alt-Az mounts offer a larger payload and size limit. These mounts are usually lightweight and compact since they can be built smaller, making them easier to carry and store. On the other hand, equatorial mounts have lower payloads and size limits since they come with extended counterweights, which are as heavy as telescopes. They therefore require more space for their counterweights to swing and are more difficult to carry and store. While a telescope with a larger aperture offers more light gathering power and a higher resolution power, it comes at the expense of being much bigger in size and heavier which are limited by the payload and size limit of the mount it uses."]},{"i":"135-reading-a-telescope-specifications","l":"1.3.5 Reading a telescope specifications","p":["The aperture refers to the diameter of the primary (objective) lens or mirror of the telescope. It is usually stated in millimeters(mm) or inches ('').","The focal length refers to the length over which light rays passing through the primary (objective) lens or mirror come to a focus on a (focal) plane. It is also stated in millimeters or inches. An image of a distant object will be visible on a screen placed on the focal plane.","This is a measure of how much an image is magnified to our eyes and is controlled by the eyepiece we use. The eyepiece also has a lens and its focal length. Magnification of a telescope is calculated by taking the ratio of the focal length of the objective lens or mirror to the focal length of the eyepiece.","This refers to the ratio of the focal length of the objective lens or mirror to the diameter of the aperture. A large focal ratio implies smaller aperture, lower light gathering power as well as a narrower field of view (vice versa). For example, a telescope whose primary (objective) focal length is 5 times that of its aperture diameter has a f-number (focal ratio) of f/5.","This is the measure of the ability to distinguish clearly small details of an object or two closely spaced from each other. The larger a telescope's aperture, the smaller the minimum resolvable angle between two distant objects and the larger its resolving power. Resolving power can be calculated from Equation and is usually expressed in arcseconds."]},{"i":"136-other-wavelengths","l":"1.3.6 Other wavelengths","p":["Telescopes are not limited to the visible light of the electromagnetic spectrum. In fact, astronomers use a number of telescopes sensitive to different portions of the spectrum to study objects in space.

Mainly used to study star birth during the early universe. Examples: Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) that is ground-based and Spectr-R that is space-based.","Primarily used to study the Cosmic Microwave Background. Examples include Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and Planck.","Infrared radiation is limited by Earth's atmosphere and such telescopes are best sent to space or used on mountaintops where the atmosphere is thin.

Although not widely accepted during its time of publication, contributions by several others such as Augustin-Jean Fresnel, Denis Poisson and Léon Foucault expanded on Huygen's work or proved the corpuscular theory otherwise, leading to the eventual acceptance of light as a wave in the mid-1800s.","In 1862, James Clerk Maxwell brought together several empirical laws that described electric fields \\mathbf{E} and magnetic field \\mathbf{B} and compiled them into a set of equations known (today) as the Maxwell's equations. By further combining the equations, he found that the \\mathbf{E} and \\mathbf{B} fields in vacuum obey","Equations that look like the above are well studied: they are known as wave equations because solutions to this class of equations are of the form of waves. Through theory, he found that electromagnetic waves travelled at the speed of light, which had been fairly accurately measured by then. Additionally, treating light as an electromagnetic phenomenon would also solve the final piece of the puzzle; polarization of light. However, light was seen as entirely unrelated to electromagnetism then; thus this finding had stirred the whole scientific community as either proof of a new revolutionary theory or an amazing coincidence in nature.","Heinrich Hertz, in 1882, experimentally generated electromagnetic waves and showed that they travelled through space at the speed of light. Essentially he created the first radio 'antenna' and 'generator'. His work proved Maxwell's equations, which were not widely accepted then, as well as unified the study of light, electricity and magnetism into the same concept. Funnily enough, when asked about the practical importance of radio waves,","\"It's of no use whatsoever[...] this is just an experiment that proves Maestro Maxwell was right---we just have these mysterious electromagnetic waves that we cannot see with the naked eye.

Light is treated as rays, and lenses serve to bend the path of light. From this, we are able to predict how light would travel. The assumption that light can be treated as simple linear rays is known as the paraxial ray theory, and hinges on the key assumption in its namesake:","Light must travel at an angle that is small when measured from the optical axis of the system.","In any optical system that we study, we must first define a principal axis. The principal axis is an imaginary line that is drawn, such that if light would approach the system nearly parallel to this axis, it would interact the same regardless of position around the principal axis. This is known as having some degree of rotational symmetry; were you to rotate around the optical axis, the system would look the same to you. If one approaches the lens from above the optical axis, it must be affected in the same way as it would if it approaches from below the optical axis; in this case, they both converge to the same spot F in the diagram.","A labelled example of a typical optical diagram."]},{"l":"Diffraction","p":["As much as we would like to treat light as rays for their simplicity, ray optics is extremely limited in explaining what light can do. If we wish to study the properties of light, then we must rely on a theory or method that hinges on the behaviour of light. The paraxial theory makes no concession for its wavelength; it is after all one of the earliest models of light. The ideas behind Huygen's Treatise are discussed from here on. To measure the wavelength of light, we must accept the behaviour of light as a wave, and as such treat it accordingly. Diffraction is one such phenomenon that is related to waves.","To understand diffraction, let us first take a step back to visualize a water wave. Imagine you throw a stone into a pond of water. What will you see?","We should see something that looks like the picture on the left, but intuitively we know that the pattern is made up of water waves that looks like the picture on the right.","The lines in picture on the left is what we call circular wavefronts. They are formed by (water) waves coming from the point source (your stone). Each line/wavefront represent a set of points at which the waves are in-phase (same \\phi angle in the sinusoidal wave). If the light source comes from very far, the circularity of the wavefronts begin to become insignificant and instead appear parallel.","Parallel wavefronts from a light source far away. Each line represents a top down view of waves; the lines connect waves at their maxima together.","Diffraction is a phenomenon which occurs when waves meets an obstacle in the form of aperture (hole) or edge. The Huygens-Fresnel principle states that every point on a wavefront can be treated as a source of a circular wave. When the waves travel parallel, each point on a wavefront emits its own circular wavefront, and cancel out because of superposition(discussed right after this.), remaining parallel. However, if the parallel wavefronts are blocked by any opaque material, some sections of a parallel wavefront can no longer cancel each other out. As such one can have a diffraction phenomenon as such:","Diffraction through slits of different sizes."]},{"l":"Superposition","p":["The superposition principle tells us that when waves physically overlap, their amplitudes can be added up. As such, the phases of the waves are important when superposing them; it can determine the amplitude of the individual waves at that point.","When two waves are in phase, such that their phase differences are even multiples of \\pi, then they are said to constructively interfere and will add up. On the other hand, if they are odd integer multiples of \\pi, then they destructively interfere with each other and results in a minimum. It is from the superposition principle that the Huygens-Fresnel principle explains and accounts for diffraction.","Go to Activity 1."]},{"l":"Diffraction Pattern","p":["Since every gap can allow for the wave to act as a point source, then a series of gaps can be treated as a series of point sources at different fixed positions. This sets up a very interesting situation, as we are in position to consider what happens between the path differences between two sources. This is known as the double-slit diffraction problem, and is easily extendable to many arbitrary slits, or equivalent sources.","Light from two (or more) slits travel a different distance to the same point on a screen. Due to the path difference, there will be phase differences and constructive/destructive interference will occur. The condition for maximum constructive interference is","where m is an integer. As a result, we see alternating bright and dark spots on the screen as the angle \\theta varies, due to constructive and destructive interference respectively.","Diagram of the double slit setup. Adapted from Peatross & Ware, Physics of Light and Optics.","We arrive at a phenomenon that depends on the wavelength of the light that we are observing: the maxima at which the interference pattern occurs depends on the wavelength. Light of different wavelengths will have maxima at different distances from the central maxima, which is denoted by y here. It was also found that the more slits there are, the sharper and clearer these maxima become. Thus, we employ diffraction gratings which have many grooves or gaps to allow light through, or reflect them, periodically across very small distances. Diffraction gratings can arise from (regular) imperfections on a surface; a metal ruler or even your phone screen can serve as a diffraction grating.","Go to Activity 2."]},{"i":"324-wave-particle-duality-of-light","l":"3.2.4 Wave-Particle duality of Light","p":["Occurring in the early 1900s was the ultraviolet catastrophe, an observation that was irreconcilable with the wave theory of light. Max Planck proposed a solution to this problem by unwillingly assuming that energy carried by light had to be quantized. The quantization of light was so successful in solving the problem that it even accurately predicted the entire emission spectrum of objects. This problem will be revisited later.","The success of quantization and particle-like light as a concept did not stop there. In 1905, Albert Einstein’s Nobel prize winning work on the photoelectric effect was also evidence of light quantization. In his experiment, he showed that by shining light of low frequency, no matter how intense, could not generate electrical current from a polished metal surface, indicating an insufficiency of energy to do so. However, once the frequency was raised past a certain value, an electrical current was observed, regardless of how strong the light was. This pointed towards some form of quantization with regards to the frequency (or equivalently, wavelength) of light. These successes reinvigorated the corpuscular theory of light.","In modern physics, we also treat light as quantized particles, capable of many things a classical particle could do such as carry momentum. Today, we understand that in the quantum regime, light exhibits both particle and wave nature, famously known as the wave-particle duality.

The technique and field of splitting light into different wavelengths and observing its interactions with other matter is known as spectroscopy. A famous and early example of spectroscopy is Newton's prism where Sir Isaac Newton was able to split light from a pinhole into its constituent colours using a glass prism.

An emission spectra is one type of spectrum, by which an object is allowed to emit light. This light is then collected and split into its constituents. For many sources such as fire, light bulbs and even the sun, a continuous spectrum was observed. However, when elements were heated and allowed to emit or excited through electrical means, scientists observed that their emission spectra were discrete and not continuous. No one was able to explain why, even though many empirical observations and formulae were written. One famous example is the Rydberg formula by Johannes Rydberg:","The Rydberg formula originally describes the relationship between the discrete emission lines observed and their wavelengths. It was eventually found to be extendable to certain specific elements such as sodium and lithium. Discreteness of the emission is captured by number n: these values are only allowed to take integer values, and emissions are described from a higher integer n_{2} to a lower n_{1}.","As heavier elements were investigated, the emission spectra quickly become very complicated; some having very fine differences as well as having many more emissions. Compare the complexity of Hydrogen's spectra to that of Iron:","Emission Spectra of Hydrogen (top) and Iron (bottom)","This then became a huge problem that physicists were unable to solve for a long time: What governed these emissions, and why were they unique to each element? Even after repeating spectroscopy on materials under different conditions such as temperature or pressure, the emission spectra remained the same. As a result, emission spectras of atoms could be used as a elemental \"fingerprint\": if one had a catalog of individual spectrum of elements, then given an unknown spectrum, one can find what elements are found in the source of the emission! This is known as atomic emission spectroscopy and is highly useful in probing materials at very low quantities.

The basis behind Schrödinger's modification hinges from work contributed by Louis de Broglie. In 1924, de Broglie proposed that our previous distinction between waves and particles, one that is well established at the height of classical mechanics, was to be blurred. He hypothesised that particles, when sufficiently small or fast, begin to exhibit wave-like properties; and when waves begin to carry enough momentum, they begin to obtain particle-like properties. The distinction that is broken is summarised in the following equation, known as the de Broglie relation:","where p represents momentum, a fundamental property of particles, and \\lambda, the wavelength, a fundamental property of waves. This was just like how light was originally thought of as waves, but eventually wave-particle duality became accepted. According to de Broglie, everything exhibits wave-particle duality. This property was eventually experimentally verified when electrons were found to behave like waves under specific conditions. This held enormous consequences; the de Broglie relation could be used to justify the quantization that Bohr proposed.","Go to Activity 7.","Applying the concept of matter waves into the Bohr model allows us to understand quantisation more intuitively.

However, what (most) scientists care about are not atoms, but rather molecules which are made up of a bunch of atoms. Thus, it is not surprising that the concept of “orbitals” needs to be extended to the context of a molecule.","But solving the Schrödinger equation to get the atomic orbital of a single H atom is already a non-trivial task, how are we supposed to do that to a molecule? Fortunately, scientists came up with an idea which allows us to obtain a decent guess of what molecular orbitals look like, but involving minimal effort. Motivated by the principle of superposition for waves, the molecular orbitals can be thought of as a superposition of atomic orbitals. This is known as the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO).","Let's start with something very simple: an H_{2} molecule. This molecule is obviously formed by two hydrogen atoms, which we name H_{a} and H_{b}. These two atoms each have their 1s orbitals, which are denoted as \\chi_{a} and \\chi_{b}. When these two atoms approach each other, the electron clouds surrounding them overlap and merge together, and thus the electron probability distribution needs be described by new functions (molecular orbitals). The possible LCAOs are:","where N is the normalisation factor. An intuitive way to understand this is to think of the wave functions as actual waves: if you recall from physics courses in the past, waves can interfere with each other either constructively or destructively. In this case, we can understand\\psi_{+} as a result of constructive interference between \\chi_{a} and \\chi_{b}, and \\psi_{-} as a result of destructive interference(see the figure below for visualization).","Formation of \\psi_{+} and \\psi_{-} (Image Credit: Seow Ryan)","Moreover, just like how each atomic orbital has its corresponding energy, here the two molecular orbitals we created also have specific energies.

On the other hand, \\psi_{-}, which comes from destructive interference, has the energy E_{2}, which is higher than the energies of the two atomic orbitals. By filling both electrons into \\psi_{+}, the total energy of the molecule is lowered compared to the two individual atoms. This is where bonding comes from!

Image credit: NASA,HST, W. Freedman, R. Kennicutt, J. Mould","An independent method of distance measurement is required before we can assign absolute magnitudes to the stars we see in the sky. One such method relies on observing a type of star called a Cepheid variable. Cepheid variables are stars that contract and expand in size periodically, brightening and dimming periodically in the process. The first discovery of such an object was o Ceti in 1595. The brightness of this star varied over five orders of magnitudes with irregular periods of between 100 to 200 days. In 1784, a pulsating star with a regular period of 5 days and 9 hours was discovered. Other similar pulsating stars were subsequently found and were called Cepheid variables. Cepheids pulsate because the competing forces of gravity (inwards) and pressure(outwards) are far from equilibrium, similar to a wildly swinging pendulum.","Variation of brightness of a typical Cepheid.","Several discoveries related to the properties of Cepheid variables made it possible to use them as independent measures of distance. The first discovery was a empirical relation between the pulsation period and the perceived brightness of the stars. Henrietta Swan Leavitt(1868 - 1921) found more than 2000 Cepheid variables, most of them located in the dwarf galaxy called the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). In 1912, she used a sample of 25 Cepheids in the SMC to show that the apparent magnitude of brightness varies linearly with the logarithm of the period of pulsation.","Plot of apparent (visual) magnitude of brightness (vertical axis) versus the logarithm of the period of pulsation. from a sample of 25 Cepheids in the SMC. The upper and lower graphs correspond to the maximum and minimum magnitudes respectively. Image credit: H. S Leavitt","Since the SMC has a diameter of about 7000 light years and its distance from us is much greater at about 200,000 light years, the stars in the SMC can be considered to be approximately the same distance from us. Hence, the linear relation between absolute magnitudes and the logarithm of their pulsation periods of Cepheids also holds.","The second discovery provided a zero point to calibrate Leavitt's linear relation. This was first carried out in 1913 by Ejnar Hertzsprung(1873 - 1967), who measured the absolute distances of a few nearby Cepheid variables via statistical parallax, a modified stellar parallax technique that used the motion of the sun as a longer baseline together with measurements of average velocities of stars. Comparing the absolute distance with the apparent magnitude of a Cepheid variable, it was thus possible to determine its absolute magnitude. The absolute magnitude could then be correlated with its pulsation period, giving a reference point to use in conjunction with Leavitt's linear relation. A recent relationship found is","It was thus possible to obtain the absolute magnitud by measuring the pulsation period of a Cepheid variable. The apparent magnitudes of the Cepheids are measured observationally as well. With the apparent and absolute magnitudes known, we can then determine the distance to that Cepheid variable using Eq.( Star Light(1)). In this way, Cepheid variables are used as standard candles to measure extragalactic distances up to 26 Mpc.","For further distances, extremely bright objects known as supernovae are used as standard candles to measure distances up to 2200 Mpc.

At thermal equilibrium, the interior of a star emits electromagnetic energy that has a continuous spectral energy density nearly similar to that of a blackbody.

Let's start off the discussion with an interesting phenomenon you have probably encountered. The pitch of an ambulance siren increases as it moves towards us while it decreases as it moves away from us. Such a phenomenon was first described by Christian Doppler and was eventually termed as the Doppler effect. When a source of sound and a listener is in relative motion relative to each other, the frequency of the sound heard is not the same as the source frequency.","To see why, let's first consider an observer and a source of sound. The source emits a sound wave with frequency, f,and wavelength \\lambda=c/f, where c is the speed of sound in air. To make things easier to visualise, consider the observer's motion in the horizontal direction.","Left: An observer and a stationary source of sound. The wavefronts reaches the observer at intervals of 1/f=\\lambda/c. Right: The source moves towards the source. The wavefronts reaches the obsever at highere frequencies, and thus shorter wavelengths.","Now suppose the source moves, say at a constant velocity of v_{s} towards the observer. The frequency and wavelength of the sound wave as perceived by the observer is now different. In one period T=1/f, the source moves by a distance of v_{s}T=v_{s}/f. The wavefronts towards to observer are compressed by this amount. The observer thus perceives a shorter wavelength, and experiences a higher frequency of recieving the wavefronts. Let \\lambda' and f' be the wavelength and frequency measured by the observer. It is conventional in astronomy to take velocities as \"recession velocities\". This means sources that move away from us take on positive velocities. Here since the source moves towards us, v_{s}<0. Hence the compressed wavelength is","where \\Delta\\lambda is the shift in wavelength. Here the source is approaching the observer, v_{s}<0,\\Delta\\lambda is negative, meaning that the wavelengths received are shorter than the originally emitted. If the source is receeding away the observer, v_{s}>0,\\Delta\\lambda>0, the wavelengths received will be longer. The frequency will shift in a similar way:","The shifts in wavelengths and frequencies are called the Doppler shifts.","The Doppler effect of sound waves require the speed of sound wave( c), velocities of the source with respect to the observer ( v_{s}) to be measured with respect to whatever medium they are travelling within. Electromagnetic waves, such as light, require no medium to propagate. Nonetheless, there is still a Doppler relation for electromagnetic waves (e.g. light) just by having knowledge of the relative velocity between the observer and the source. Here, we quote the result and shall not derive the relation:","where c here is the speed of light. In the low (source) velocity limit where v_{s}\\ll c, the above equation reduces to Eq.( 3). In practical astronomy, this is almost always the case and hence the simpler formulae Eqs.( 2) and ( 3) are usually used.","Generally all celestial objects are in relative motion with us, hence all astronomical spectral lines are Doppler shifted.","Astronomers define the redshift of a spectral line by","This term gives a intuitive picture of shifted spectral lines shfted towards higher wavelengths due to recession velocities. Together with Eq.( 1) we see that the higher the (recession) velocity, the greater the redshift."]},{"i":"544-binary-stars-and-exoplanets","l":"5.4.4 Binary stars and Exoplanets","p":["The use of astro-spectroscopy has led to many interesting astronomical discoveries. Here, we briefly discuss how spectroscopy is used to detect binary stars and exoplanets.","A binary star system is a system of two stars that are gravitationally bound and orbit around each other about a common center of mass. While some binary star systems are resolvable by using a telescope, more often than not either the resolving power of the telescope presents itself as a limiting factor or the relative brightness between the stars is too large, resulting in a situation where the glare from the brighter star makes it difficult to observe the fainter star. In such situations, astro-spectroscopy is a useful tool in helping to detect binary star systems through the analysis of the Doppler effect on their stellar spectra.","The absorption lines in the stellar spectra of each star are first blueshifted and then redshifted, as each star moves towards us and then away from us about their common center of mass, with the period of their common orbit. In some spectroscopic binaries, the spectral lines of both stars are visible and lines alternate between single and double. In other systems, only the spectrum of one star is observed and the lines periodically blueshift and redshift. By carefully analysing the Doppler shift of the spectral lines, it is possible to determine the radial velocity of the system and even the shape of the binary orbit.","Absorption lines getting doppler shifted. In this visual, the yellow star emits light, with absorption lines marked in dotted lines. As the large planet orbits around it, the star wobbles forward and backward. When a star is receeding from us, its wavelength increases, making it redder. Similarly, when the star moves towards us, its wavelength increases, making it bluer. The absorption lines of the star as it is moving is presented as filled lines. Image Credit: Alysa Obertas","Astro-spectroscopy also offers a useful indirect method of detecting exoplanets. If the exoplanet is gravitationally bound to a host star, both of them will orbit about a common center of mass. Again, we search for the Doppler shift (periodic blueshift and redshift) in the stellar spectrum of the host star as the star moves towards and away from us. However, compared to binary star systems, the spectral shift brought about by an exoplanet can be much less prominent and harder to detect if the planet is much smaller in size and orbits far from its host star, causing the radial velocity of the star-exoplanet system to be relatively much smaller compared to a binary star system. Therefore, this method is best used for detecting massive exoplanets orbiting close to their host stars, since this will allow for a much larger radial velocity of the system and thus a more observable Doppler shift in the spectral lines of the stellar spectra.","The discovery of the first exoplanet was made in 1995 by Swiss astronomers Michael Mayor and Didier Queloz using astro-spectroscopy, who were both subsequently awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics.

While it seems neccessary for to believe in the existence of a new energy content in the Universe to account for the new observational evidence for an accelerating Universe, no one has a concrete idea of what this energy is. It has never been directly or even indirectly observed. All we could do is to \"reason\" that it must be there, in dominating amounts! Astronomers call this mysterious energy \" dark energy\"","Assume that the Universe was initally dominated by radiation, and \\rho_{\\text{r},0}>\\rho_{\\text{m},0}>\\rho_{\\Lambda}.
