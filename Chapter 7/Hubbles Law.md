## 7.2 Hubble's Law

![Photographs of some galaxies and their spectra captured by Milton
Humason using the 100 inch Mount Wilson Telescope. As shown the fainter
the galaxy (thus further), the more red-shifted its spectrum is.](</Resources/Chapter 7/Humason_redshift_spec.png>)

In 1920s, Edwin Hubble and Milton Humason began to measure spectra
of galaxies. Hubble found that the amount of redshift of a galaxy
is not a random value, but directly proportional to the distance away
from us. Using the observational data (see Sec. \ref{subsec:Hubble's-data}),
he published in 1929 a relationship between distance and recession
velocity of a galaxy, now known as the Hubble's law

$$
\begin{equation}
v=H_{0}d
\end{equation}
$$

The Hubble parameter $H_{0}$ is an empirically fitted value. The
subscript 0 is a convention that astronomers use to indicate that
the value is as measured at current time $t_{0}$. (Theoretically
the Hubble parameter can be a function of time, so it could be very
different say 10 billion years ago.) Since Hubble's 1929 report, various
groups have obtained different values of the Hubble's constant. Recent
measurements narrows the value to be around 70 $\text{kms}^{-1}\text{Mpc}^{-1}$.[^1]

for an overview of recent techniques and results on the the measurement
of Hubble's constant.

The redshift of galaxies that Hubble found follow a rule that is applicable
to the entire Universe. For this reason, we call this redshift the
**cosmological redshift**.

Cosmology is the study of the Universe as a whole.
How did Hubble's work impact the field of cosmology?

See Pre-Lecture homework on Hubble's data and
the Cosmological principle. Why do you think that Hubble proposed
a linear relationship based on his seemingly scattered data?

us (and from each other)?

and Cosmological redshift?
