# The Expanding Universe

#### Learning Objectives

In this chapter, you will first examine Hubble's 1929 data, and with
the cosmological principle in mind develop an understanding of the
expanding Universe. You will then apply some of the concepts you have
learned in earlier chapters to construct models of the expanding Universe.
By solving the cosmological models, you will be able to determine
the evolution of our Universe in different energy conditions.

#### Learning flow

We will spend 2 weeks for this chapter. 

In week 8 lecture, we begin with Hubble's law and describe the expanding
Universe using a Newtonian model (Section 7.2 and 7.3). We will also
start on the spacetime metric for an expanding Universe (Section 7.4)
for flat and sppherical space. 

In week 9 IS, we will solve the differential equations (Friedmann
equations) for the Newtonian expanding Universe numerically. We will
also understand some of the consequences of the equations via the
discussion questions (Q1 and Q2).

In week 9 lecture, we will continue the section (7.4) on the spacetime
metric for expanding Universe. We will finally discuss the cosmological
models that are derived from Einstein's theory of General Relativity.

In week 10 lecture, we wil review what we have learnt so far and if
time permits, discuss some of the questions at the end of the chapter.
