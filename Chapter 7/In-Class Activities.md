## 7.6 In-Class Activities

### Activity 1
#### The Curved Space of a 2-Sphere

#### Triangles on a 2-sphere

Blow a balloon into an approximately nice spherical shape. Define
the north and south poles on your balloon. Draw a set of longitudes
using a fine marker. Draw the equator as well.

Form a triangle with 2 longitudinal lines and the equator, draw it
out with a thick marker. 

Measure the interior angles of the triangle and find the sum of the
three angles.

#### Geodesics on a 2-sphere

A geodesic is a generalised notion of a straight line. It is the shortest
distance between two points in space. It is the line whereby a non-accelerated
body will move on. 

Blow another balloon into a sphere. Mark out two points on the balloon
and call them NiuLang and ZhiNÃ¼. How would you draw the shortest distance,
aka the geodesic, between them?
