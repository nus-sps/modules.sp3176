## 4.5 Discussion Questions
---

1. Explain how colour can arise from molecules.

---

2. Electronic transitions for molecules occur in the UV-vis regime. 

a. One limitation of UV-vis spectroscopy for molecules is the lack
of specificity. Discuss what this means and why this is so.

b. Despite its limitation(s), UV-vis spectroscopy is widely used
in research labs. What are some common uses of UV-vis spectroscopy?

---

3. The figure below is a simulated rotation spectrum
of CO. Estimate the internuclei distance of CO.

---

4. The molecule Cyanoacetylene $\text{HC}_{3}\text{N}$
exhibits a spectral line at 9.098 GHz for the $4=1\rightarrow0$ transition.

a. What is the rotational constant in units of GHz?

b. In what catagory of the EM spectrum does this
line belong to? (radio/microwave/IR/visible/UV/X-ray)

c. What are the positions of the spectral lines
corresponding to the transitions $J=2\rightarrow1$, $J=3\rightarrow2$,
$J=4\rightarrow3$, etc.?

d. Simulate the rotational (emission) spectrum
of Cyanoacetylene $\text{HC}_{3}\text{N}$ at $T=10$ K, 50 K and
100 K.

---

5. Derive an expression for the most probable $J$ transition line
for rotational spectroscopy. (Hint: use Eq.([QM(6)](<The Quantum Molecule#probability>))). 

Suggest how we can estimate the temperature of the observed object
using rotational spectroscopy.

---

6. By referring to the following figure, suggest why the range of
isotopes would result in a different wavenumber.
