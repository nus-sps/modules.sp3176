#### Interstellar Reddening

Stars behind the dark molecular cloud B68 could not be seen at optical
wavelengths, but reveal themselves when viewed with infra-red light
optics and detectors. This also means that when viewed over an extended
broadband spectrum, the light from behind the cloud will look redder
than it actually is. This is known as interstellar reddening, and
B68 presents a pretty extreme case of it. 

What is interstellar reddening in general? When we learned about diffraction
of light, we saw that red light diffracts less than green or blue
light. Such wavelength dependence is generally exhibited when the
size of the object in the path of the light is comparable to the wavelen
gth of the light. When light **scatters** off small particles,
red light is less affected and are able to transmit more easily through
a region of gas than its shorter wavelength counterparts. This is
the reason why the sun looks red when it is low on the horizon at
dawn or dusk. Conversely, blue or shorter wavelength light scatters
more and this is the reason why the sky the blue!

With the use of telescopes that see in infra-red light, we can peer
*through* the dense cloud of B68. But what if we want to know
what is inside the cloud itself? Take a spectrum! Or equivalently
in the context of radio astronomy, view the cloud at wavelengths corresponding
to molecular transition!

#### Identification of Molecules

Recall that molecules have rotational energy levels, and transitions
between these levels absorb or emit wavelengths in the microwave/radiowave
regime. In the interstellar medium (ISM) where temperature is cold,
these low energy transitions can take place quite frequently. Taking
a spectrum or viewing the ISM at these wavelengths reveal a wealth
of chemical species. 

!!! Try it yourself!
See the spectrum and table below. Try to identify
some of the chemical species in TMC-1.

Astro-chemists do not typically present their data like in the figure above ([TMC-1](#TMC-spec)).
It is hard to analyse and more importantly misses out on molecules
that are not-so-abundant. A nicer representation of molecular spectrum
is as follows:

We used the 30 m IRAM millimeter-wave telescope located at Pico Valeta
in Spain for the observations reported here. Observations were obtained
during three periods: 2000 April and August and 2001 April. The dual
mixer, dual-channel receiver was tuned to observe the J Â¼ 1 0 transition
of C^18^O at 109.78218 GHz, the $1-0$ transition of N~2~H ^+^ at 93.173178 GHz, and the $J=2-1$ transitions of C^32^S at 97.980968
GHz and C^34^S at 96.412982 GHz. Observations of the $J=1-0$
transition of C^17^O and the $J=3-2$ transition of N~2~H ^+^
were also obtained and reported elsewhere.

Although not as widely probed, ro-vibrational spectrums are also taken
and analysed by astro-chemists. Some examples are shown below.
