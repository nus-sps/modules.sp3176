### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be familiar with some concepts
of molecular spectroscopy. You will be introduced to techniques and
methods used to locate, identify molecules based on their fingerprints,
and how molecules are identified in space. Finally, you will have
the opportunity to explore recent datasets of astrochemistry research.

### Learning Flow

Before week 5 lecture, do the [pre-lecture homework](<Pre-Lecture Homework>) and briefly read
through the lecture notes.

During week 5 lecture, we will go through most of the content in this
chapter. As usual, some activitie will be incorporated to break the
monotony. If we run out of time, part of the content may be discussed
in week 6 lecture.

In week 6 IS, we will discuss the [questions](<Discussion Questions>) at the end of the chapter.
