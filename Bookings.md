# Booking Equipment

You'll need to book the Dry Lab and the ASpec experimental setup prior to using it. Add a booking on the calendars below with your SPS account, detailing when you would be using it.

If you're using the telescope for Astro Night, please do leave a booking on the calendar too. This prevents conflicts between groups!
